# Mux Dashboard

The developer console for **Mux Protocol** — manage API keys, track wallet creation, and monitor account activity on Stellar.

Mux Dashboard is the interface for developers building on Mux. It provides visibility into the **Invisible Wallet system** while abstracting away all blockchain complexity.

---

## Overview

Mux Dashboard allows developers to:

* **Create and manage API keys** for SDK access
* **Track Stellar account creation** on Testnet and Mainnet
* **Monitor wallet activity** and balances
* **View usage metrics** such as transaction counts and account status
* **Configure basic project-level settings**

End users do not interact with this dashboard — it is purely for developers integrating Mux into their applications.

## Core Principles

* **Developer-first UX**: designed for fast onboarding and management
* **Invisible Wallet visibility**: see accounts and activity without exposing keys or blockchain jargon
* **Safe and clear**: all actions are explicit; sensitive operations are handled by the backend

---

## Key Features

* **API Key Management**: generate, rotate, and revoke keys
* **Wallet/Account Tracking**: monitor accounts created via the SDK
* **Activity Metrics**: view transaction volumes and status
* **Network Switching**: testnet vs mainnet tracking
* **Usage Monitoring**: see platform-sponsored actions and account health

## Design Philosophy

* The dashboard is **developer-focused**, not end-user focused
* **Backend handles wallets and transactions**; the dashboard is a monitoring and management tool
* Makes it simple to **observe, control, and integrate** Mux-powered wallets

---

## Roadmap

* Per-key usage analytics
* Webhooks and notifications for SDK events
* Team access management
* Audit logs for all wallet and API activity
